`ots` is an R client to retrieve data from various ocean time series datasets, including:

* BATS
* HOT
* CALCOFI
* LTER Kelp
* UOPG
* more to come...

What's the point of getting data from the web in R? This way we only have to solve the problem of how to efficiently get a dataset once, then you can benefit from that. In addition, this should allow you to get any changes to the dataset that appear, or corrections. Last, getting data programatically in R should get you one step closer to a reproducible workflow, one that makes science easier primarily for yourself, and for others using your work.

## Install

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/ots")
```

```{r}
library("ots")
```

## Easy integration with dplyr

```{r}
library('dplyr')
tbl_df(bats_zooplankton()$data) %>% 
  filter(sieve_size > 1000) %>% 
  group_by(cruise) %>% 
  summarise(mean_water_vol = mean(water_vol))
```

## BATS - Zooplankton dataset

```{r}
bats_zooplankton()
```

## BATS - Production dataset

```{r}
bats_production()
```

## HOT dataset

```{r}
hot()
```

## Channels Islands National Park kelp data

```{r}
kelp("benthic_cover")
```

## CALCOFI data

```{r}
calcofi('hydro_cast')
```

## UOPG data

Various datasets available through this source - in this example getting data from Biowatt, and getting the meteorology data. Note that we still need to fix the column names...

```{r}
(biowatt_met <- uopg(dataset = 'biowatt', type = "meteorology"))
```

## More coming...
